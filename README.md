# Telecom Churn Prediction

In the highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

A leading telecom firm wants to predict which customers are at high risk of churn to reduce customer churn. In this project, we will analyse customer-level data, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

## Objective of Data Analysis & Model Building:
Customer level data of 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th month is given. The objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months for the high value costumers. The high value costumers have been defined as those who have recharged with an amount more than or equal to X, where X is the 70th percentile of the average recharge amount in the first two months (the good phase).
